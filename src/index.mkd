## Features

The distribution consists of configuration and resource packages
installed on top of Debian. There are no changes to the way the Debian
base system is administrated.

* Pre-configured [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) window
  manager with [tint2](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2) panel,
  [conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) system monitor and
  [jgmenu](https://github.com/johanmalm/jgmenu), a flexible replacement desktop menu.
* Assortment of harmonising GTK2/3 themes, wallpapers and
  [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) configurations
* Various configuration and application utilities to maintain this
  system
* Additional desktop-, multimedia- and hardware-related packages come
  pre-installed to offer a better "out-of-the-box" experience.

There is no limit to customization: You can review desktop
configurations in our forums' [Artwork & Screenshots](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=8) section,
and we also host [several active threads](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=9) on conky
configuration. As an example, here's an user-contributed [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/TUXohePdiR4) showing
what kind and style of desktop experience you may end up with.

## Architectures

We offer combined [live-CD and installation media](/installation.html) for the Debian
**amd64** (x86-64) architectures and **i386** (i686) architectures.

The main focus is on the DVD-sized amd64 ISO, it comes fully featured. The CD-sized i386 ISO is a
slimmed down version meant to support older computers, but can after installation be expanded to
include all features.

Our main repository currently offers support for
the amd64, i386, armhf (arm32v7) and arm64 (aarch64, arm64v8) Debian ports. Note that BL is tested
thoroughly only on amd64 and i386, so your mileage may wary on more exotic architectures.

## Community support

In general, we recommend new users to [visit and sign up for  our
forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org): It provides plenty of resources
and assistance in dealing with every configuration aspect of the BL
distribution, and is the main platform for user-to-user support as well
as the place to voice suggestions and report bugs.

There are a few independent communities, see [here for a list](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/faq.html#independent-channels).
