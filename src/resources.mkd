## Community and communication

The following communication channels are considered ‘official’:

  * [Forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org)
  * IRC channel [#bunsenlabs@freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net:6697/#bunsenlabs)
  
As you may know, we had been using the [CrunchBang Linux forums](http://crunchbang.org/forums)
in the beginning. Registrations over there are now closed, but there's
much knowledge left for you to harvest.

Communities have also sprung up elsewhere:

  * On Google+, there is [BunsenLabs en Español](https://plus.google.com/communities/102155480089831191422)
  * [DeviantArt group](http://bunsenlabs.deviantart.com/)

## Core packages and bug reports

**Detailed package indices and content listings are available on the
['repositories'](https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org) page.**

If you have a bug to report, you may do so either [on the
forums](http://crunchbang.org/forums) or, ideally, to the package's
issue tracker.  Use the VCS browser links provided below to browse the

containing packages backported from Debian testing and imported from
Ubuntu. A list of packages is available
