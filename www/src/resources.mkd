## Community and communication

The following communication channels are considered ‘official’:

  * [Forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org) -- this is our main communication channel
  * IRC channel [#bunsenlabs@freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net:6697/#bunsenlabs)
  
As you may know, we had been using the [CrunchBang Linux forums](http://crunchbang.org/forums)
in the beginning. Registrations over there are now closed, but there's
much knowledge left for you to harvest.

Pages have also sprung up elsewhere:

* User [Balloon](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?pid=8855#p8855) has created an extensive resource in Japanese: [BunsenLabs Japan!・ブンゼンラボ ジャパン！](http://bunsenlabs-jp.jimdo.com/), including instructions and translations for a Japanese localization
* On Google+, there is [BunsenLabs en Español](https://plus.google.com/communities/102155480089831191422)
* [DeviantArt group](http://bunsenlabs.deviantart.com/)

### Packages and bug reports

**Detailed package indices and content listings are available on the
['repositories'](https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org) page.**

If you have a bug to report, you may do so either [on the
forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=14) or, ideally,
to the package's issue tracker.  Use the VCS browser links provided
below to browse the package sources.

### Third-party and backported packages

We maintain an auxiliary repository named **jessie-backports**
containing packages backported from Debian testing and imported from
Ubuntu. A list of packages is available
[here](http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/repoidx.html#distro-jessie-backports).

## Dark website themes

Both the BL [www](https://www.bunsenlabs.org) and
[pkg](https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org) domains have optional dark CSS themes.
The colours were derived from FluxBB's *Mercury* theme.

You can switch between the bright and dark themes by setting or clearing
a cookie via the links in the matrix below. At the moment, JavaScript is
also required to be enabled for the dark theme to work.

| Domain | Bright (default) | Dark |
|:-------|:----------------:|:----:|
| www.bunsenlabs.org    | [■][theme-www-bright] | [■][theme-www-mercury] |
| pkg.bunsenlabs.org    | [■][theme-pkg-bright] | [■][theme-pkg-mercury] |

## Miscellany

* See the [commit log](gitlog.html) for an overview over recent development activity.
* Here is a [list](stuffweuse.html) of (mostly free and) open-source
  software we are using to run the BL project.
