## Repositories

To use our repositories, follow the instructions below: Set up the APT
configuration and import our signing key.

### bunsen-hydrogen

This is our main repository which contains our core packages.

Set up a file at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bunsen.list` with the
following [contents](templates/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bunsen.list):

~~~
deb http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian bunsen-hydrogen main
~~~

### jessie-backports

This is an auxiliary repository containing packages backported from
Debian testing and imported from Ubuntu.

Set up `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bunsen-jessie-backports.list` with the
following
[contents](templates/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bunsen-jessie-backports.list):

~~~
deb http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian jessie-backports main
~~~

The backports repo's packages will have a pin priority of 100, so
regular jessie packages will continue to take precedence until you
explicitly install a backported package.

To upgrade a package to its backports version, target the backports
distribution as follows:

~~~ { .bash }
sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install ${PACKAGE_NAME}
~~~

Subsequent package upgrades will be installed from the backports repo or
the regular repository, whichever package version is
higher.

### Source archives

Package sources may be retrieved using the `apt-get source` command. To
be able to do so, duplicate the lines in your `.list` files and
change the archive type to [`deb-src`](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList#Archive_type).

### Access via HTTPS

You may change the `http://` prefix in your BL repository URLs to
`https://` in order to access the repositories using an encrypted
connection. Before setting this up, ensure that the package
[`apt-transport-https`](https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=all&searchon=names&exact=1&keywords=apt-transport-https)
is installed on your system. The package is part of the BL standard
installation.

### Mirrors

We currently operate two repository mirrors. If you specify the host
`pkg.bunsenlabs.org` in your APT configuration, you will be redirected
automatically to the preferred server based on your IP addresses
geolocation:

* Users residing in Australia, Oceania and Asia get redirected to
  `asia.pkg.bunsenlabs.org`; the server is located in Singapore.
* Other users stay on `pkg.bunsenlabs.org` which is identical with
  `eu.pkg.bunsenlabs.org`; the server is located in Germany.

If you get redirected to `asia.pkg.bunsenlabs.org` but notice that your
ISP has a faster route to the EU server than the Singapore one, put
`eu.pkg.bunsenlabs.org` into your APT configuration in order to opt out
from the redirect. Similarly, users in Europe, the Americas or Africa
for whom `asia.pkg.bunsenlabs.org` is faster should switch to that mirror.

## Signing key

Fetch and verify the repository's [signing key][SigningKey]:

~~~ { .bash }
wget https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc
gpg --with-fingerprint BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc
~~~

The key's fingerprint as displayed by gpg should be identical with the
following hexstring:

~~~~~
3172 4784 0522 7490 BBB7 43E6 A067 3F72 FE62 D9C5 
~~~~~

If that is not the case, you have got the wrong key. Use a safe,
non-intercepted internet connection in order to retrieve the correct key
file.

Finally, add the key to APT and update the package index:

~~~ { .bash }
sudo apt-key add BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc
sudo apt-get update
~~~

You may now install <monospace>bunsen-\*</monospace> packages provided
by the repository.
